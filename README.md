# Practicum by Asraf's Projects
A variety of Data Science projects completed during my participation in the Practicum education course. These projects covered tasks such as data preprocessing, analysis, and visualization, statistical analysis, machine learning, text-based machine learning, time series analysis, computer vision, and others.
